            <h3>The History Of Roland TB-303</h3>
            <p>How did the TB-303 bass synthesizer become such a well-known and highly regarded sound in dance music? Today
                guest contributor Akhil Kalepu goes in-depth with the full history of the Roland TB-303 and how its shortcomings
                became some of the most sought after sounds in the era of acid house that followed.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Featured gear: </strong>TB-303</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturer: </strong>Roland</li>
                <li><strong>Date Released: </strong>1982(production ended 1984)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In a world of <span>software emulations <img src="assets/images/software-emulation.png" alt="Computer Icon"></span> digital workstation, it’s hard to be impressed by a single oscillator monosynth,
                but few electronic musical instruments have made an impact as big as the TB-303. Several machines have entered
                electronic music history as pivotal artifacts of the culture. Released in 1982, Roland’s “Transistor Bass”
                unit was a sleeper hit that became an iconic piece of electronic music culture, analogous to the Stratocaster
                for rock and the MPC for hip-hop.</p>

            <p>Created by Roland engineer Tadao Kikumoto, the box was largely written off as a failure after just 18 months
                of production. It was released alongside the TR-606 drum machine as an accompaniment for guitarists, but
                with unrealistic sounds and a difficult interface the box got little traction upon release. Roland stopped
                production in 1984, having sold only 10,000 units.</p>

            <h3>The TB-303’s Quirks</h3>
            <p>While many of the 303’s early appearances made use of the box’s unconventional nature, the acid house sound did
                not come together until the late 80s. Due to its commercial failure, there were lots of these bass units
                available for a low price, making them an attractive buy for bedroom electronic producers.</p>

            <p>TB-303 Producers could choose either a saw or square wave, which is shaped from a saw wave using a single-transistor
                circuit, giving it a distinctive sound different from typical square waveforms. The TB-303 also has controls
                for decay, cutoff, resonance and envelope modulation which controls a 4-pole 24dB low-pass filter. All of
                this comes together with the 303’s notoriously difficult to use sequencer, which allowed users to control
                accent and portamento for each note.</p>
